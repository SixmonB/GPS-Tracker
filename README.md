# GPS-Tracker
This project was developed for the final exam of the Microprocessors course in university as a two-person task.

The idea was to create a small device with a BluePill board to get position signals and send them to a specific phone number in case of a stolen car. The concept can be
extended to whatever object we want to track and find, e.g. suitcases, dog, etc. We worked with STM32CubeIDE software for configuration and coding.
The used modules are:
GSM/GPRS SIM800L
GPS Ublox Gy-neo6mv2
STM32F103C8T6 - BluePill
